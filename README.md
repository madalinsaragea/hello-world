# hello-world
First touch on GIT, learning it!

My name is Madalin and I am 25 years old. I decided to start learning to code and I aspire to become a software engineer in the future. 

This segment of software development is a good choice as a career for me, since I am always looking for new challenges and I am prone to change and adaptability. 

Also, the idea of creating and maintaining a product/project alongside a handful of dedicated people and engaging in problem-solving situations sounds like the perfect profession for me (found myself struggling until now to find a job that is dynamic and engaging).

Studying a bit how software development works and the how-to's in this field made me change my mind about my current job immediately(Research-Analyst).

I strongly aggree with the fact that programming is a job that requires continous self-development and learning(or learning how to learn) and I am enthusiastic about the idea of being able to work as a programmer.

Cheers ^^
